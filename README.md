**Introduction**
This is a content-based filtering movie recommendation engine that recommends movies to users based on their movie preferences. The engine uses machine learning algorithms to analyze the user's past movie ratings and recommends new movies that match the user's preferences. The system works by creating a user profile that captures the user's movie preferences and then compares it to a database of movie attributes to find similar movies.

Usage
To use the recommendation engine, follow these steps:


Data
The movie dataset used by the recommendation engine is a subset of the TMDB Movies dataset. The dataset includes movie attributes such as genre, cast, director, and plot summary.

Algorithm
The recommendation engine uses the cosine similarity algorithm to find similar movies based on their attributes. The algorithm computes the cosine similarity between two movie vectors and returns a value between 0 and 1, with 1 indicating a perfect match.

Limitations
The content-based filtering movie recommendation engine has some limitations. It relies heavily on the movie attributes, and it may not recommend new or lesser-known movies that do not have a lot of attributes in common with the user's preferences. Additionally, it does not take into account the user's social connections or trends in the wider movie industry.
